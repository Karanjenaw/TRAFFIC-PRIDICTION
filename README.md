🚦 Predictive Traffic Congestion System with Route Optimization
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based traffic prediction system that helps users avoid traffic jams and reach their destinations faster. By analyzing historical and real-time traffic data, the system predicts congestion levels and suggests optimized routes to save time and reduce travel stress.

🔍 Features
🔁 Real-time traffic data analysis

📈 Traffic congestion prediction using ML algorithms

🗺️ Smart route optimization based on traffic conditions

📍 Interactive map interface for route display

⚡ Faster and more efficient travel recommendations

🧠 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap (for mapping and routes)

Flask / Streamlit (for UI)

Jupyter Notebook (for model development)

✅ Use Case
Imagine you're about to leave for work. This system can suggest the fastest and least congested route based on live traffic and historical patterns — ensuring a smoother commute.
